# Toolkit

Some useful tools for the second part of the Cybersecurity course @UniPd

## Requirements
- Disassembler -> we use ***Radare2*** (alternative: *Ida*)
    - *to download Radare:* https://github.com/radareorg/radare2
    - *to download Ida (free version):* https://www.hex-rays.com/ida-free/
- Debugger -> we use ***GDB***
    - it should already been installed if you have Linux *(on Windows you will need to install it, please note that in this case MinGW distributes a Windows version of it)*
- Other tools useful for pwning:
    - ***PEDA*** *(i.e. Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB)* available to download at: https://github.com/longld/peda
    - ***pwntool*** *(python library)*, available to download at: http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/


> ***PLEASE NOTE:***  Before doing anything it's necessary to change the permissions of the directory we want to work on. We can achieve this with:   ``` chmod -R +x ./ ```


## Reverse Engineering
# Some useful commands (to use from terminal):
- ***./name_of_the_program***
    - to simply run a program in the terminal
- ***strings ./name_of_the_program***
    - to show all the strings used by the program (e.g. if there is a psw or a flag stored it should appear)

# Ida
To open Ida from terminal:
```
cd idafree-8.1/
./ida64
```
To disassemble a file click on *New* and then *Ok* on the *Quick Start* window that opens up. You should now see all the ASM code of the program on the right side 
(included the branches generated by the jump instructions) and the various functions on the left side.
