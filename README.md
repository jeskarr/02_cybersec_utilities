# Toolkit

Some useful tools for the second part of the Cybersecurity course @UniPd

## Requirements
- Disassembler -> we use ***Ida***
    - *to download Ida (free version):* https://www.hex-rays.com/ida-free/
- Hexadecimal editor -> we use ***Radare2*** (alternative: *Hex Editor*)
    - *to download Radare:* https://github.com/radareorg/radare2
- Debugger -> we use ***GDB***
    - it should already been installed if you have Linux *(on Windows you will need to install it, please note that in this case MinGW distributes a Windows version of it)*
- Other tools useful for pwning:
    - ***PEDA*** *(i.e. Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB)* available to download at: https://github.com/longld/peda
    - ***pwntool*** *(python library)*, available to download at: http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/


> ***PLEASE NOTE:***  Before doing anything it's necessary to change the permissions of the directory we want to work on. We can achieve this with:   ``` chmod -R +x ./ ```


## Reverse Engineering
### Some useful commands (to use from terminal):
- ***./name_of_the_program***
    - to simply run a program in the terminal
- ***strings ./name_of_the_program***
    - to display all the strings used inside the program (e.g. if there is a psw or a flag stored it should appear)
- ***objdump -option ./name_of_the_program***
    - to display information about one or more object files. The options control what particular information to display, we can for example choose the option -d (--disassemble) which display the ASM code of the input files.

### Ida
To open Ida from terminal:
```
cd idafree-8.1/
./ida64
```
To disassemble a file click on *New* and then *Ok* on the *Quick Start* window that opens up. You should now see all the ASM code of the program on the right side 
(included the branches generated by the jump instructions) and the various functions on the left side.

### Radare2
Radare2 is particulary useful for patching. Let's see some Radare commands (that we use on the terminal) that help us doing it:
-To open the file using Radare2 *(-w to enable writing on it)*:
```
r2 -w name_of_the_file
```
> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** it's recommended doing a copy of the file and working with radare on it, rather than the original one

### GDB
To run a file using GDB, i.e. debugging it:
```
gdb name_of_the_file
start
```
To add a breakpoint:
```
b*memory_address
```
